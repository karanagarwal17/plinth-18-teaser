# Plinth '18 Teaser

Teaser for Plinth, The Techno-Management Literary Fest, The LNM Institute of Information Technology, Jaipur.

## Live Hosts

The project is hosted on http://karanagarwal.me/plinth-18-teaser.

## Description

For the loading animation, we wrote the SVG paths for 'Coming Soon' in the same font as the Standard Font for Plinth.
Then We used Anime.Js for animating and synchronizing the fill-in and fill-out animations for every letter.

For the main site, we used Animation Frames to run the animation where the stars are approaching the black hole and it is getting bigger.
Clicking on the screen generates some more stars from the point of click.

Finally, when the size of the black hole reaches a certain radius, a callback triggers an event which loads the logo and details for the fest.
